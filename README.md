# KNN-Classifier
This project involves implementing and analyzing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers to distinguish between three species of iris flowers based on their physical measurements. The project includes implementing both normal KNN and distance-weighted KNN from scratch, evaluating the effect of varying the number of neighbors (K), and examining the robustness of the classifiers to noise and the curse of dimensionality.
